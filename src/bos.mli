(** Named string patterns.

    Named string patterns are strings with variables of the form
    ["$(VAR)"] where [VAR] is any sequence of bytes except [')'] or
    [',']. In a named string pattern a ["$"] litteral must be escaped
    by ["$$"].

    Named string patterns can be used to {{!format}format} strings or
    to {{!match}match} data. *)

  (** Quick and dirty program arguments parsing.

      This is for quick hacks and scripts. If your program evolves to
      a tool for end users you should rather use {!Cmdliner} to parse
      your command lines: it generates man pages and its parsing is
      more flexible and user friendly. The syntax of command lines
      parsed by this module is a subset of what {!Cmdliner} is able to
      parse so migrating there should not be a problem for existing
      invocations of your program.

      This module supports short and long options with option
      arguments either glued to the option or specified as the next
      program argument.  It also supports the [--] program argument to
      notify that subsequent arguments have to be treated as
      positional arguments. Parsing functions always respond to the
      [-h], [-help] or [--help] flags by showing the program's usage
      and command line options documentation.

      See the {{!argbasics}basics}.

        A path pattern [pat] is a path whose segments are made of

        greedily matches a segment or sub-segment. For example the path
        pattern:
{[

]}
        matches any existing path of the file system that matches the

        {b Warning.} When segments with pattern variables are matched
        against the file system they never match ["."]  and
        [".."]. For example the pattern ["$(file).$(ext)"] does not
